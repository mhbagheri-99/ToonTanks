# Toon Tanks
## _A Cartoonish lowpoly Shooter_

In this project, I tried to explore deeper into C++ usecase in an Unreal Engine project. I made components, pawns, game mode, controller and features in the C++ and learned how to exploit the power of scripting and handling some connections and definitions in Blueprints as well. I also learned about the timers, particles system and some basics of HUD widgets. 

## Implemented Features

- Count down timer in the game start up
- Player takes control of the tank pawn
- Shooting projectile functionality for the pawns in the game
- Developed a very basic AI for the Towers to shoot the tank
- Health Component for the pawns to keep track of damages taken
- A game over screen and function (Victory or Loss)
- Binding my scripted functions to some predefined functions such as OnComponentHit and OnTakeAnyDamage

## Upcoming and possible features

Some features that I am planning to implement and add to the game before publishing are as follows:

- Developing a more advanced enemy system (Improving their AI, Adding tanks as enemies as well as towers)
- Add a menu with settings to the game
- Power up pick ups or level up system
- Make the Tanks Movement shake the camera slightly to give a sense of accelaration and motion to the user (Currently it seems like the player is controlling the tank on a drone above the tank that just shakes from the explosions)
- Add a text system to tell a little story about the game to make it a more immersive experience
- Add music to the game 
- Develop a more complex Level with more details and enemies
